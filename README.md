Please check what license each map uses on our [website](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/mapstack/overcast?s=cardinal) before using them on public servers. If you wish to use a non-commercial map for commercial purposes, please get in contact with the map authors. Our policy regarding maps, map downloads, and map acquisition can be found [here](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/policies/maps).

Your repository will automatically update as more maps are added and tested with Cardinal ensuring that you only get functional maps. If you do find a map that isn't working as expected in the repository, please create an [issue on our tracker](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-cardinal-maps/issues/new).
